# City Bike App

This is a bike journey displaying app implemented as a programming exercise.

## Configuring the app

To configure the app:
- Set environment variables `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and `POSTGRES_DB` in `docker-compose.yaml` to appropriate ones.
- Set environment variables `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD` and `DB_NAME` in `/backend/.env` to chosen values.
- Comment out or remove `ports` field of `db` container from `docker-compose.yaml` file if you don't need the database container to be externally accessible.

## Starting the app

To start the application, use command `docker-compose up` in the root directory.
If you want to import data to the database, place `stations.csv` and `journeys.csv` files to the `/database/data` directory before starting the application.


## Used technologies and why they were chosen
- TypeScript
  - Widely used in web-development currently.
  - Makes writing code without bugs easier.
- PostgreSQL
  - I have used PostgreSQL in my past projects.
- TypeORM
  - Makes it easier to interact with database and switch it to another one if needed.
  - Supports many popular databases (for example MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).
  - I wanted to try to use ORM instead of regular SQL queries.
- Express.js
- Node.js
