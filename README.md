# City Bike App

This is a bike journey displaying app implemented as a programming exercise.

## Chosen technologies and why they were chosen:
- TypeScript
  - Widely used in web-development currently.
  - Makes writing code without bugs easier (compared to JS).
  - I personally am interested in the language.
- React
  - Widely used in web-development currently.
  - I have used React with JS in my past projects.
- PostgreSQL
  - I have used PostgreSQL in my past projects.
- MikroORM
  - Makes it easier to interact with database and switch it to another one if needed.
  - Supports many popular databases (for example MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).
  - I wanted to try to use ORM instead of regular SQL queries.
- GraphQL
  - Seems like an easier to handle REST alternative.
- Node.js
