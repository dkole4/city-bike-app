# City Bike App

This is a bike journey displaying app implemented as a programming exercise.

## Using the app

To start the application, use command `docker-compose up` in the root directory.
If you want to import data to the database, place `stations.csv` and `journeys.csv` files to the `/database/data` directory before starting the application.


## Chosen technologies and why they were chosen:
- TypeScript
  - Widely used in web-development currently.
  - Makes writing code without bugs easier (compared to JS).
  - I personally am interested in the language.
- React
  - Widely used in web-development currently.
  - I have used React with JS in my past projects.
- PostgreSQL
  - I have used PostgreSQL in my past projects.
- TypeORM
  - Makes it easier to interact with database and switch it to another one if needed.
  - Supports many popular databases (for example MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).
  - I wanted to try to use ORM instead of regular SQL queries.
- Express.js
- Node.js
